Welcome to the **Diamond Price Prediction MLOps Project**! This project demonstrates the end-to-end automation and deployment of a machine learning pipeline using modern tools like Airflow, MLflow, Docker, DVC, and AWS EC2. It focuses on predicting diamond prices based on key features like carat, clarity, and cut, depth , dimensions, table, etc. The Stacked neural network model results in great R2 score of 98%.

## üöÄ Project Summary

This project involves building a machine learning model for predicting diamond prices and deploying it in a fully automated MLOps pipeline. The project is hosted on **AWS EC2** and leverages **Docker** to containerize multiple services such as:

- **Airflow**: To orchestrate and manage the entire machine learning workflow.
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model versioning.
- **Flask**: For serving the machine learning model via a REST API.
- **DVC**: For data version control and reproducibility.

The components are designed to run seamlessly within Docker containers, making the pipeline portable and scalable.

## üìö Features

### üîÑ End-to-End Pipeline Automation
- Automated Data Ingestion, Transformation, Model Training, and model Serving.
- Created one Stacked Model of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and XGBOOST to create a meta model which gave the prediction score (R2) of 98%.
- Airflow DAGs handle the complete workflow for orchestrating tasks such as **data ingestion, transformation, model training, and deployment**.

### üß¨ Model Versioning with MLflow
- MLflow tracks the performance metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts of each experiment.
- Easily switch between models and compare different runs to find the best-performing version.

### üì¶ Containerized Deployment with Docker
- Entire system packaged into **Docker containers**, ensuring consistency across environments.
- Separate Docker containers for **Airflow, MLflow**, and **Flask** services.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS EC2 Hosting and ECR Container Registry
- Deployed the entire pipeline on **AWS EC2** for cloud scalability.
- Data is stored and versioned in **AWS S3** using DVC, ensuring efficient data management.
- Container Images are stored in **AWS ECR** Public and Dockerhub : sid2983/airflow:latest and sid2983/flask:latest

### üì° REST API for Predictions
- A **Flask** app serves the model and exposes a REST API to make predictions.
- Use `POST` requests with JSON payloads to get diamond price predictions.

### CI-CD Pipeline using Github Actions 
- Job for Continuous Integration after testing
- Job for Building and Pushing Images to Docker Registeries (ECR and Dockerhub)
- Job for Continuous Deployment on AWS EC2 instance.
